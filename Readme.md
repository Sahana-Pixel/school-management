# School Management API

## Overview

The School Management API is a RESTful service built with Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. It allows users to:

- Add new schools with details like name, address, latitude, and longitude.
- Retrieve a list of schools sorted by proximity to a specified location.

This project demonstrates handling geolocation-based data and building scalable APIs using modern JavaScript technologies.
